# Create an EtherLite validator node on [VULTR](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6881736) or [DIGITAL OCEAN](https://m.do.co/c/e2c65321d0d2) server Ubuntu 20.04

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN, YOU WILL NEED:
- 100000 EtherLite (ETL)
- A command line program e.g. http://www.putty.org
- A [VULTR](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6881736) or [DIGITAL OCEAN](https://m.do.co/c/e2c65321d0d2) server with Ubuntu 20.04
- An ability to follow instructions to the letter!!!
- Be aware, you are setting up a Validator Node on a remote server, and keeping your EtherLite Coins on a local MetaMask wallet. Your EtherLite Coins are never in danger from the remote server

### You are now ready to configure your Server!

Recommended Server Size: 1 CPU Premium Intel/AMD or High Frequency with 2GB of RAM and 25+GB SSD (will work on 1GB of RAM with a SWAP file see below) Note that you will have to Resize/Upgrade you Droplet/Server over time as the Blockchain will increase in size as well as the number of transactions per block.

1. If you have < 2GB of RAM on the system. Weâ€™ll have to set up a swapfile. If you have the required 2GB, feel free to skip to next step.

   ```bash
   sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
   sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50
   ```

2. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
   
   curl https://get.docker.com | sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. Sync Clock:

   Your clock should by synchronized to prevent skipping block sealing.

   Enter `timedatectl status` , you should see similar output:

   ```bash
   Local time: Tue 2020-06-30 17:16:19 UTC
   Universal time: Tue 2020-06-30 17:16:19 UTC
   RTC time: Tue 2020-06-30 17:16:19
   Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
   System clock synchronized: yes
   systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes
   RTC in local TZ: no
   ```
   If System clock synchronized displays yes and Time zone is set to UTC, proceed to step 4.
   
   If not, get help here: https://vitux.com/how-to-sync-system-time-with-internet-time-servers-on-ubuntu-20-04/
   
4. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antares21scorpi/validator-node-dockerized
   cd validator-node-dockerized
   ```

5. Download the OpenEthereum From EtherLite Releases.

   ```bash
   curl -L "https://github.com/etherlite-org/openethereum/releases/download/v3.2.2-rc.1/openethereum-ubuntu20.04.zip" -o openethereum.zip
   ```

6. Install unzip to unzip the downloaded OpenEthereum zip.

   ```bash
   apt install -y unzip
   ```

7. Unzip the OpenEthereum zip
   ```bash
   unzip openethereum.zip
   ```
8. Create password file for mining account.
   ```bash
   echo "YOUR-VAL-UNIQUE-PASS" > password
   ```
9. Create your mining account

   ```bash
   ./openethereum account new --keys-path=data/keys --password=password --chain=etherlite
   
   Save the return address for stept 10
   ```

10. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

11. Update `.env` file. There are a few settings you need to define:

   ```bash
   nano .env
   
   Update Parameter below.
   
   EXT_IP=YOUR-EXTERNAL-IP-ADDRESS
   ACCOUNT=0x...
   ```

   - `EXT_IP` - External IP of the current server.
   - `ACCOUNT` - Your mining address (with leading `0x`).

12. Start your node.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

   After docker containers are created, the node will sync with the chain (may take a while, 3+ hours).

   To restart you need to use `docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose start` being in the `validator-node-dockerized` directory.

13. Check if sync is completed.

    ```bash
    curl --data '{"method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8545
    ```
    
   This is what you're waiting to see: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":false,"id":1}

   ### Security is important on this side too, so you must now secure your Server.

   Enter the following commands EXACTLY (in this order) to set up your firewall:

   Please note: Make sure you enter the code in this order! If you do not, the program will not work! You can disable your firewall anytime by entering (as root;)): `ufw disable`

14. Setup Firewall.

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow ssh/tcp
    sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp
    sudo ufw allow 8545/tcp
    sudo ufw allow 30303
    sudo ufw allow 8546
    sudo ufw logging on
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw status
    ```

   (Optional) For more protection you can install [Fail2ban](https://linuxize.com/post/install-configure-fail2ban-on-ubuntu-20-04/) to avoid brute force attact.

14. Setup Monitoring with a crontab entry.

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 755 /root/validator-node-dockerized/cron/watchdognode.sh
    crontab -e
    
    Add this line to the end of the file. save and exit.
    
    * * * * * $HOME/validator-node-dockerized/cron/watchdognode.sh > $HOME/validator-node-dockerized/cron/watchdognode.log 2>&1
    ```

   ## All done now! You are now a Validator Node Master...
